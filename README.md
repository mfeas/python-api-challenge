# python-api-challenge
**Module Six Challenge**

For the first half of the challenge in WeatherPy I used a jupyter notebook with python to pull random cities latitudes and longitudes for me to pull the temps, humidity, cloudiness for comparisons. Using this data I was able to create visuals displaying the cities proximity to the equator versus those particular items. Once I had all the data sorted and displayed, I was able to start on the second half of the challenge- determining my ideal vacation location! I used the available data once again to narrow down my breezy, warm temperate dream spot. With all the data pulled my ideal vacation would involve a stay in the Ndutu Safari Lodge in Al Aaroui, MA, Africa! 


I utilized the starter code provided to guide me through with aiding resources from geeksforgeeks, stack overflow and Bing AI. I did struggle some with the code for the WeatherPy City Lat vs Max Temp, my temps were insanely high and I'm still not sure what caused it or how I managed to fix it. I pulled colors to try to get the best possible match to the examples for my plots settling on cadetblue.
